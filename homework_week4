#Plot1. Males/females with hip fracture.
```{r}
ggplot(data = hf_summary) +
geom_bar(aes(x = sex))
```
 #Result of plot 1.: According to this dataset 2,5 times more females than males got hip fractures in whole obsrvation time.
 
#Plot2. Amount of females/males who got hf by year.
```{r}
ggplot(data = hf_summary) +
geom_bar (aes(x = year, fill = sex))
```
#Result of plot 2. Comparing to 2009-2016year less people got hf year 2017. Can be due to incomplete data.

#Plot 3. Amount of females/males who got hf grouped by age.
```{r}
ggplot(hf_summary, aes(age, fill = sex)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10)
```
#Result of plot 3. People at age 70-90 are more likely to get hf. But, if you take into the account the life span of population, it would b possible to say, that people older than 70 are more likely to get hf. Reason of decrease of the amount of hf at age 90-100 can be small group size.


#Plot 4. Amount of males/females grouped by age and county.
```{r}
ggplot(data = hf_summary, aes(x = age, y = county, color = sex)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.3, alpha = 0.3, position =  position_jitter(0.2))+
  facet_wrap (~ sex)
```
# Result of plot 4. Data correlates with plot 3. Not really relevant, because gives information about amount of hf, not % of population. Should be normalized to population of each county.


#Plot 5. Amount of males/females with different type of hip fracture.
```{r}
ggplot(hf_summary, aes(fracture_type, fill = sex)) +
  geom_bar()
```
# Result of plot 5. There is ~ 10 times more femoral neck or pertrochanteric hfs, than cubtrochanteric hfs.


#Plot6. Relation between acute therapy vs post acute therapy time.
```{r}
ggplot(data = hf_summary, aes(x = acute_therapy, y = post_acute_therapy, color = sex)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
#Result of plot 6. People who spent more time getting acute therapy are more likely to spend more time getting post-acute therapy.
